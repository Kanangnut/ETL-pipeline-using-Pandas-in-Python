# ETL pipeline using Pandas in Python

<b>Context</b><br><br>
At the outset, I will set up an account to obtain an API key for streamlined data requests. Prioritizing security and to prevent direct embedding of the API key in the source code, I will establish a configuration file named config.py. This project focuses on constructing an ETL pipeline, encompassing data extraction, transformation, and loading processes, to collect information from The Movie Database (TMDB) website.
<br><br>
These csv file contained dataset of movies listed and including to, <br>
<b>dataset:</b> The main Movies Metadata file. Contains information of movies featured in the movie database. Features include backdrops, budget, revenue, release dates, posters, languages, production companies and countries.<br>
<b>tmdb_movies_info:</b> Contains the movie title, vote, movies plot from TMDB website. Available in the form of a stringified JSON Object.
