# ETL pipeline using Pandas in Python

<b>Context</b><br><br>
At the outset, I will set up an account to obtain an API key for streamlined data requests. Prioritizing security and to prevent direct embedding of the API key in the source code, I will establish a configuration file named config.py. This project focuses on constructing an ETL pipeline, encompassing data extraction, transformation, and loading processes, to collect information from The Movie Database (TMDB) website.
