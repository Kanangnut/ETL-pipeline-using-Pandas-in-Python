# ETL pipeline using Pandas in Python

<b>Context</b><br><br>
At the outset, I will set up an account to obtain an API key for streamlined data requests. Prioritizing security and to prevent direct embedding of the API key in the source code, I will establish a configuration file named config.py. This project focuses on constructing an ETL pipeline, encompassing data extraction, transformation, and loading processes, to collect information from The Movie Database (TMDB) website.
<br><br>
These csv file contained dataset of movies listed and including to, <br>
<b>dataset:</b> The main Movies Metadata file. Contains information of movies featured in the movie database. Features include backdrops, budget, revenue, release dates, posters, languages, production companies and countries.<br>
<b>tmdb_movies_info:</b> Contains the movie title, vote, movies plot from TMDB website. Available in the form of a stringified JSON Object.

<b>API key</b><br>

api_key = 'api key'

Create the pythonFile.py for:
 - This script extracts data from a website without any transformation or cleaning.
 - The purpose is to explore the raw data and understand its structure.
 - Your code for extracting data goes here
 - Save the raw data to a CSV file without any cleaning or transformation
 - This step helps in understanding the nature of the data and planning for the ETL process
 - Code for saving data to a CSV file

Create the pythonCSV.py for:
 - This script creates a CSV file after applying the ETL (Data Extraction, Data Transformation, Data Loading) pipeline to the data obtained from a website using an API key.
 - Import necessary libraries for data manipulation and API requests
 - Save the cleaned and transformed data to a CSV file
 - Code for saving data to a CSV file
